死了还要用——孔子 

Confucius, a Chinese thinker and social philosopher, has exerted a significant influence on the thought and life of Chinese, whose philosophy emphasized personal and governmental morality, correctness of social relationships, justice and sincerity, which gained prominence in China over other doctrines, such as Taoism or Legalism.

我要一步一步往上爬——马斯洛需求金字塔 

In 1954 American psychologist Abraham Maslow proposed that all people are motivated to fulfill a hierarchical pyramid of needs. At the bottom of Maslow’s pyramid are needs essential to survival, such as the needs for food, water, and sleep. The need for safety follows these physiological needs. According to Maslow, higher-level needs become important to us only after our more basic needs are satisfied. These higher needs include the need for love and belongingness, the need for esteem, and the need for self-actualization (in Maslow’s theory, a state in which people realize their greatest potential).

For example, a well-dressed man seldom spits at random, a woman in glorious dresses is more likely to talk in a gentle tone, and a clean dressed child seems quiet than others. It might be explained that different dresses give people different self-images, and most people subconsciously behave according to their own self-images. 

A parvenu on the other hand, will finally find out the fact that his exorbitantly dear dresses is of no use to make him a gentleman, and he even eventually fail to make him look like a gentleman. Maybe those are right who said it takes at least three generations to cultivate a gentleman. 

青少年的外表与内心 

Already, it can be seen how western movies are exercising influence on our youth generation: they grow long-hair regardless of their sex, commonly part of which are dyed in gold; they wear jeans in each and every season, usually knees of which are deliberately tattered; boys are fond of earrings or other odd pendants; and girls are keen on Marlboros and weird coarse languages. 

食： 

There is no love sincerer than the love of food.  - George Bernard Shaw It’s amazing how pervasive food is. Every second commercial is for food. Every second TV episode takes place around a meal. In the city, you can’t go ten feet 



  

without seeing or smelling a restaurant. There are 20 foot high hamburgers up to billboards. I am acutely aware of food, and its omnipresence is astounding. 

Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince, and dinner like a pauper. 

Tomatoes and oregano make it Italian; wine and tarragon make it French. Sour cream makes it Russian; Lemon and cinnamon make it Greek. Soy sauce makes it Chinese; garlic makes it good. 

Food is our common ground, a universal experience. A dinner lubricates business. 

You don’t have to cook fancy or complicate masterpieces - just good food from fresh ingredients.

健康 

运动运动 

In contemporary society, a multitude of people are increasingly aware of the fundamentality of maintaining health, so as to enjoying better life quality and longevity. In order to possess a healthy body, not only need we keep a nutritious diet and adequate sleep, it is crucial for individuals to form the habit of exercising regularly, as sports and health are intrinsically connected. Doing sports will greatly increase people's metabolism, and strengthen our physique. Sports also help to refresh people's mind from brainwork all day and night, and even more surprisingly, exercising can stimulate people's brains to work more actively and creatively. Overall, sports are not the business of a small group of athletes, but a life-long pursuit that every person should bear in mind and endeavor to put it into practice. Not only do sports benefit individuals, the improvement of the nation's health would be a huge contribution to our country's development. 

We might also cite an allegorical story. It is said that an individual’s life is accompanied with five balls, which are lover, family, career, health and friend. Lover, family, career and friends are all rubber balls, consequently, it could bound back when falling to ground. On the contrast, health is the unique glass ball, which is fragile enough to be ruined with a single drop. 

The increasingly sedentary lifestyle will engender a higher incidence of ailments. More overweight people means more patients suffering from cardiovascular diseases such as vein hardening, diabetes and hypertension. 

便利（节省时间\时间灵活\交通\休闲\健身\娱乐\吃喝\购物） People are concerned about the efficiency with the accelerating tempo of life. The more the better. The fast the better. In this regard, XX takes the top priority. For instance, whenever people click on a search engine and key in a few words into the search box, they will get huge amounts of information. The amazing thing is, all the searching is done in a few seconds, which spares people a great 



  

deal of time to enjoy the entertainment such as body-building, watching opera or a movie in their leisure time.

Telecommuting can spare workers the everyday chore of traveling back and forth to work. 

Global cultural homogeneity has immensely enriched the lives of the denizens in developing countries. For instance, now Holly wood blockbusters typically get their first screening in China within a couple of days after their American premiere, and youths in China can download singles topping billboard charts from the Internet without having to scout around in a CD store. Enhanced TV connectivity affords Chinese viewers chances to see primetime American TV shows. This ease of access to a multitude of foreign amusements has really brightened up the lives of many.

旅游 

Travel is more than the seeing of sights; it is a change that goes on, deep and permanent, in the ideas of living. 

艺术 

Art is the desire of a man to express himself, to record the reactions of his personality to the world he lives in. 

Art is the collaboration between God and the artist, and the less the artist does the better. 

Art is born of the observation and investigation of nature. 

Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up. 

摄影 

Photography, fortunately, to me has not only been a profession by also a contact between people - to understand human nature and record, if possible, the best in each individual. 

音乐 

Music has charms to soothe the savage beasts, to soften rocks, or bend a knotted oak. 

音乐的魅力能感化凶残，软化岩石，还能柔化多节的橡树。 

My heart, which is so full to overflowing, has often been solaced and refreshed by when sick and weary. 

我无比充实的心灵总是能在它悲伤和疲倦的时候因为音乐而重获快乐和活力。 

I think I should have no other mortal wants, if I could always have plenty of music. It seems to infuse strength into my limbs and ideas into my brain. Life seems to go on without effort, when I am filled with music. 

Develop interest in life as you see it; in people, things, literature, music - the world is so rich, simply throbbing with rich treasures, beautiful souls and interesting people. 

Fashion 



  

A fashion is nothing but an induced epidemic. 

Fashion is a form of ugliness so intolerable that we have to alter it every six months. 

休息☺

Leisure hours are of great importance for people. Living under stress for a long time is harmful to health, causing symptoms such as ulcer and high blood pressure. If a man insisted always on being serious, he would go mad or become unstable without knowing it. The secrets of energy lie in the art of having leisure. 

动物： 

Animals are such agreeable friends - they ask no questions, they pass no criticisms. - George Eliot 

A person can learn a lot from a dog, even a loopy one like ours. Marley taught me about living each day with unbridled exuberance and joy, about seizing the moment and following your heart. He taught me to appreciate the simple things - a walk in the woods, a fresh snowfall, a nap in a shaft of winter sunlight. And as he grew old and achy, he taught me about optimism in the face of adversity. Mostly, he taught me about friendship and selflessness and, above all else, unwavering loyalty. 

☺ If a dog jumps in your lap, it is because he is fond of you; but if a cat does the same thing, it is because your lap is warmer. 

The dog was created especially for children. He is the god of frolic. Dogs are not our whole life, but they make our lives whole. 

God loved the birds and invented trees. Man loved the birds and invented cages. 

We call them dumb animals, and so they are, for they cannot tell us how they feel, but they do not suffer less because they have no words. 

Sir Winston Churchill once said, “I like pigs. Dogs look up to us. Cats look down on us. Pigs treat us as equals”. 

家庭 

Call it a clan, call it a network, call it a tribe, or call it a family. Whatever you call it, whoever you are, you need one. - Jane Howard. 

It is dismal coming home, when there is nobody to welcome one! Happiness is having a large, loving, caring, close-knit family in another city. 

Marriage 

A great marriage is not when the “perfect couple” comes together. It is when an imperfect couple learns to enjoy their differences. 

A successful marriage really requires falling in love many times, always with the same person. 



  

That is what marriage really means: helping one another to reach the full status of being persons, responsible and autonomous beings who do not run away from life. 

Children 

I have found the best way to give advice to your children is to find out what they want and then advise them to do it. 

A mother only does her children harm if she makes them the only concern of her life. 

Friendship makes prosperity more shining and lessens adversity by dividing and sharing it.

内在驱动和外在刺激 

Drives and desires can be described as a deficiency or need that activates behavior that is aimed at a goal or an incentive. These are thought to originate within the individual and may not require external stimuli to encourage the behavior. Basic drives could be whereas more subtle drives might be the desire for praise and approval, which motivates a person to behave in a manner pleasing to others. 

By contrast, the role of extrinsic rewards and stimuli can be seen in the example of training animals by giving them treats when they perform a trick correctly. The treat motivates the animals to perform the trick consistently, even later when the treat is removed from the process. 

教育：内在动机的驱动 

	Intrinsic motivation is the drive for which people engage in an activity, without obvious external incentives, such as a hobby. Intrinsic motivation has been studied by educational psychologists since the 1970s, and numerous studies have found it to be associated with high educational achievement and enjoyment by students. 

is thought that students are more likely to be intrinsically motivated if they: 
	1.  Attribute their educational results to internal factors that they can control (e.g. the amount of effort they put in). 

2.  Believe they can be effective agents in reaching desired goals (i.e. the 
	results are not determined by dumb luck). 

3.  Are interested in mastering a topic, rather than just rote learning to 
	achieve good grades.

Leonardo da Vinci is best remembered as the painter of the Mona Lisa (15031506) and The Last Supper (1495). But he's almost equally famous for his astonishing multiplicity of talents: he dabbled in architecture, sculpture, engineering, geology, hydraulics and the military arts, all with success, and in his spare time doodled parachutes and flying machines that resembled inventions of the 19th and 20th centuries. He made detailed drawings of human anatomy which are still highly regarded today. Leonardo also was quirky enough to write notebook entries in mirror (backwards) script, a trick which kept many of his observations from being widely known until decades after his death. 

学一科还是学多科 generalist 



  

Professionals and specialists have always found knowledge of other disciplines helpful and inspiring. 

If students are allowed to enroll only in the courses that will help prepare them for jobs in their chosen fields, the blockades between disciplines will not only hamper discoveries at the boundaries, but also preclude infusion of fresh ideas and inspiration. 

With a broader knowledge base, students can choose disciplines of concentration, complexity, and profundity according to their interest. As a saying goes, interest is the best teacher. You cannot account on one to succeed in a field in which he is not interested in and the scarcity of the interest can lead to a disappearance of creativity too.

经验的重要性: 

Work and experience create and broaden our knowledge. It is of value to test the veracity of the indirect book knowledge by applying it to reality. Sir Isaac Newton, applied mathematics to his personal experience, resulting the discovery of kinetic theory. Nicholus Copernicus, through extensive observation and existing scientific analysis, calculated the earth and other planets’ orbit around the sun. Such knowledge is now easily assessable in textbooks, but would require decades of work on our own to research and understand that phenomenon. 

Books are valuable when knowledge is beyond the scope of our experiences. Perhaps the most obvious examples are those fluent writers. They write various stories, the scopes of which are far beyond any individual's experiences. Take Joyce Carol Oates for example, her productivity has been prodigious, accumulating in less than two decades to nearly thirty titles, including novels, collections of short stories and verse, plays and literary criticism. Although some of them appear to come from her own direct observations, her dreams, and her 



  

fears, much more is clearly from the experiences of others. Her fictive world remains strikingly akin to that real one reflected in the daily newspapers, the television news and talk shows, and the popular magazines of our day.

Barbara McClintock 

Barbara McClintock (June 16, 1902 - September 2, 1992), the 1983 Nobel Laureate in Physiology or Medicine, was an American scientist and one of the world's most distinguished cytogeneticists. McClintock received her PhD in botany from Cornell University in 1927, where she was a leader in the development of maize cytogenetics. The field remained the focus of her research for the rest of her career. From the late 1920s, McClintock studied chromosomes and how they change during reproduction in maize. Her work was groundbreaking: she developed the technique for visualizing maize chromosomes and used microscopic analysis to demonstrate many fundamental genetic ideas, including genetic recombination by crossing-over during meiosis—a mechanism by which chromosomes exchange information. Encountering skepticism of her research and its implications, she stopped publishing her data in 1953. Later, she made an extensive study of the cytogenetics and ethnobotany of maize races from South America. McClintock's research became well understood in the 1960s and 1970s, as researchers demonstrated the mechanisms of genetic change and genetic regulation that she had demonstrated in her maize research in the 1940s and 1950s. Awards and recognition for her contributions to the field followed, including the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine, awarded to her in 1983 for the discovery of genetic transposition; she is the only woman to receive an unshared Nobel Prize in that category. 

William Harvey (1578-1657), English physician, who discovered the circulation of blood and the role of heart in propelling it, thus refuting the theories of Galen and laying a foundation for the modern physiology. Harvey’s De Motu Cordis subjected him to serve criticism by some contemporaries, but this was more than compensated for by the later widespread recognition of his contribution.

竞争与合作 

While cooperation is the antithesis of competition, the need or desire to compete with others is a common impetus that motivates individuals to organize into a group and cooperate with each other in order to form a stronger competitive force. Cooperation in many areas such as farming and housing may be in the form of a cooperative or alternately, in the form of a conventional business. 

Many people resort to this because they may cooperate by trading with each other or by altruistic sharing. 

Certain forms of cooperation are illegal in some jurisdictions because they alter the nature of access by others to economic or other resources. Thus, cooperation in the form of cartels or price-fixing may be illegal.

The development of science and technology has always accompanied the progress of the society. The invention of the steam engine brought a new era of thrift of world economy; the employment electricity has multiplied the productivity and virtually reproduced limited resources on the Earth; the innovation of computer technologies has made the Earth a little village and connected distant countries as a single market. While sometimes the progress of science and technology, for example, technology of human cloning, cause troubles or originate dilemmas, it seems always undeniable that in a broad sense, the development of science has provided people a much higher standard of living than that of their counterparts in any phrase of the history. 

Science has been developed by continuous modification, and at the same time always reflects the progress of the society. Visualization and fascination have been the major power of any form of art. For example, any religion in this world cannot exist without music, which helps realize the faith of the church to an astonishing extent. Each and every revolution on this earth was accompanied by numerous corresponding art productions, because the artists sense the circumstances, and then reflect their sensations with sophisticated techniques in their production, which can be easily perceived by the public through powerful empathy. Nobody could evaluate art with correct or not standard, needless to say the public, they simply feel it is good or not, therefore art has always had magic influence on the public, and society in general. 

思维创造性与技术 

Though many reasons can be cited for the accelerating pace of technological inventions, on major cause is the role played by mental creativity in an increasing atmosphere of freedom. Political freedom and liberation from religious dogma had a powerful impact on creative thinking during the period of Enlightenment. Dogmas and superstitions had an incredibly restrictive effect on the scope for mental creativity. For example, when the astronomer Copernicus proposed a heliocentric view of the world, it was rejected because it did not conform to established religious doctrine. When Galileo perfected a telescope for 



  

viewing the planets, his invention was condemned by churchmen as an instrument of the devil as it seemed to be so unusual and hence fit to be deemed heretic. Such obscurantist fetters on freedom of thought were shattered only with the coming of the Enlightenment. From then on the spirit of experimentation began to thrive. 

社会进步有赖于其他社会组织——科技进步的重要性 

The development of technology is dependent on the presence of other types of social organizations. Nobel laureate economist Arthur Lewis observed that the mechanization of factory production in England which became known as the Industrial Revolution was a direct result of the reorganization of English agriculture. The enclosure of common lands in England generated surplus income for the farmers. That extra income generated additional raw materials for industrial processing along with greater demand for industrial products which was difficult to meet by traditional manufacturing processes. The opening of sea trade gave an added boost in demand for industrial production for export. Factory production increased many times when production was reorganized using steam energy combines with moving assembly lines, specialization and division of labor. Thus, technological development was both a result of and a contributing factor to the overall development of society. 

物质与非物质 

The role of physical resources tends to diminish as society moves to higher levels in the scale of development. Correspondingly the role of non-material resources keeps increasing as development advances. One of the most important nonmaterial resources is information, which has become a key input in modern times. Information is a non-material resource that does no get exhausted by distribution or sharing. Greater access to information helps increase the pace of its development. Ready access to information about economic factors helps investors to immediately transfer capital to those sectors and areas where it will fetch a higher return. The greater input of non-material resources helps explain the rising productivity of societies in spite of a limited physical resource base. 

论证非物质提高生产力——关于数据的论证 

The application of higher non-material inputs also raises the productivity of physical inputs. Modern technology has helped increase the proven sources of oil by 50% in recent years and at the same time reduced the cost of search operations by 75%. Moreover, technology has shown that it is possible to reduce the amount of physical inputs in a wide range of activities. Scientific agricultural methods demonstrated that soil productivity could be raised by application of synthetic fertilizers. Dutch farm scientists have demonstrated that a minimal water consumption of 1.4 litters is enough to raise a kilogram of vegetables compared to the thousand liters that traditional irrigation methods normally require. Henry Ford’s assembly line techniques brought down the man-hours of labor required to deliver a car from 783 minutes to 93 minutes. These examples show that the greater input of higher non-material resources can raise the productivity of physical resources thereby extending their limits. 



  

脑力劳动优于体力劳动 

Humanity relied more on muscle-power than thought-power to accomplish work. That is no longer the case. Today mental resources are the primary determinant of development. He who drove a simple bullock cart has now designed ships and aircraft that carry huge loads across immense distances. He has tamed rivers, cleared jungles and even turned arid desert lands into cultivable lands through irrigation. By using his brains he has turned worthless sand into powerful silicon chips that carry huge amounts of information and form the basis of computers.

Tutoring over the Internet is also available. Business on the Internet is a growing technology. Business on the Internet has no geographic boundaries; it has access to more consumers. Approximately 150 businesses join the Internet every day. There is less labor force needed and it is open 24 hours a day. The Internet is also a bigger and cheaper way to advertise. In the past 20 years, the Internet has changed a number of areas in society, especially the business world. In the last 40 years, the Internet has gone from a method of defense communication for the government, to a business venture for an entrepreneur or a fortune 500-company. The Internet is a way for gaining consumers, products and capital for a business. 

In a world of light-speed data transmission, any individual with little training and expertise can make a fortune from the Internet. Many companies, like Amazon.com or eBay, thrive from business done through Internet transactions.

The Internet has many great uses, but, as anything else, negative things can be done there as well. The beauty of the Internet is that it is so large that it’s nearly impossible to keep track of what bad things everyone is doing. A few examples are someone can steal a cell phone and then by using the Internet, they can reprogram the telephone to work off someone’s account and not be traced. Other examples are the pirates of software. Someone can get a program that Microsoft sells for about one thousand dollars for free and it can’t be traced. There is another fact that nearly anything can be traded online, like drugs, weapons such as high power guns, bombs, and the list for these items goes on and on. One of the worst things that the police really want to get their hands on is Child Pornography. It is not so hard to keep track of when people had to go out and hand deliver this stuff, but through the Internet the scum who partake in this don’t have to leave their homes. A big problem is the fact that underage kids can see what they are not meant to. This does not just end up back at porn though; there are images of extreme violence on humans and animals. 

技术提高了人类生存条件还是恶化了人类生存条件 

Philosophical debates have arisen over the present and future use of technology in society, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar movements criticize the pervasiveness of technology in the modern world, claiming that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as trans-humanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition. Indeed, until recently, it was believed that the development of technology was restricted only to human beings, but recent scientific studies indicate that other primates and certain dolphin communities have developed simple tools ad learned to pass their knowledge to other generations.

The major means that mass media influence the public is by creating topics of discussion in the society. Mass media offers people (the consumers) issues to talk and think about. Titanic had brought a worldwide uproar by its extolling and of fascinating immortal love; Prime Color and Wag the dog met the national debate on right and duty of the president of the United States. Antiwar movies such as Tears of the Sun and All Quiet On The Western Front among numerous others have been raising the question that is any war really to uphold justice or is it really worthy that an individual makes sacrifices to his country and at the same time ignores his own family or his personal values? 

We all admire even envy those who now have attained great achievements, such those famous stars as, Jacky Chen, Jet Li, for example. We should, however, be aware of the exorbitant prices they have paid for their present glories.
